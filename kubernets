orchestration system for docker containers.
kubernets executes docker containers and manage the containers

follow the master-slave(worker) node architecture.
master node controller is kube-api-server(entry point for all the rest commands, maintain complete inflow and outflow of the cluster)
Etcd- ditribute db for k8s.in lost of cluster we can recover from Etcd. in prod environment its mandatory to externalize etcd db from k8s cluster.
kube-scheduler - it got information regarding slave nodes then it schedule suitable node on slave.

worker node- pods,services,kubelets,kube-proxy
kubelet- direct connection with kube api server on master node and it will manage the state of worker node.
kube proxy is component which will provide the connection btw containers(instance of my application so end user can acces it and do their work) and external parties
